# RRC ASN1 Definitions

This repo contains a script that extract LTE and NR RRC ASN1 definitions from [wireshark repo](https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark).\
Each minor version is extracted to a dedicated sub-directory of definitions.\
Some post-processing is applied to the definitions to make them more compatible with [mts-asn1](https://github.com/HandyMenny/mts-asn1) and [uecapabilityparser](https://github.com/HandyMenny/uecapabilityparser).
